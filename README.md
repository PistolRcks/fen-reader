# FEN String Reader (in Rust)
## What is this?
I wanted to learn Rust, so here is a FEN [(Forsyth-Edwards Notation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) String reader. Its one input expects a FEN String. (It also panics if the FEN string is misformatted, but I don't care to fix that).

That is all.

## Licensing
Yes, I *did* put this under the [MIT License](LICENSE) (found in the `LICENSE` file). No, I do not care if this is unnecessary.
